# Methodology

## 1. Survey Design:

•	The research was based on a survey form which was shared with people via WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn. 

•	It was mostly based on numeric Multiple-choice Questions. and was not at all time taking, considering that survey forms are not pleasant to fill. Also, a headline was also included at the beginning that promises to share insights with the respondents. This small incentive was added to motivate respondents to complete the survey.

•	After some responses, few ammendments were made in the form to improve clarity. For example: the question “Which problem you think can be solved using technology?” was removed. Many respondents were avoiding this question by entering a hyphen or leaving the field blank, indicating reluctance to answer. By removing this question, the survey became more straightforward, resulting in improved completion rates.
